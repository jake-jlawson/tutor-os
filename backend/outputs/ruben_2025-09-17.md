# Lesson Title: "Refining Personal Statement for Oxbridge Engineering Applications"

# Summary & Student Progress
In today's session, the primary focus was on refining Ruben's personal statement for his Oxbridge engineering application. Ruben had an existing draft and wanted to cut it down by approximately 600 characters while maintaining high quality. This lesson was pivotal since a well-crafted personal statement is crucial for making a strong application for competitive university programs such as Cambridge Engineering.

We began by discussing the nature of the content to determine what should remain and what could be eliminated without losing valuable insight. The lesson included a deep review of sentence structure and essence to ensure clarity and conciseness. Ruben showed an understanding of the importance of linking ideas cohesively throughout his statement. One approach we took was to use AI tools like ChatGPT to propose more succinct ways of phrasing his ideas.

Ruben displayed strong engagement and readiness to adapt suggestions into his statement. He understood the necessity of elaborately connecting areas where his passion for engineering intersects with other interests like AI and energy, which are recurring themes in his personal statement. He recognized the value of conveying technical understanding and insights gained from experiences within his statement, rather than relying heavily on soft skills. 

Feedback points for Ruben include:
- Aim to link each paragraph of the personal statement back to a central theme or interest for coherence.
- Focus more on technical experiences and how they influenced his passion for engineering. 
- Avoid using clichés or generic statements about soft skills unless they add significant value.
- Ensure personal reflections in the statement, connecting learning experiences to future aspirations.
  
# Homework & Plans for Next Session
Since Ruben is in the process of refining his personal statement, I suggest he reviews the feedback provided during the session and applies it to the revised draft. This includes tightening the language further, ensuring all statements are necessary and impactful, and enhancing the technical reflections. He is encouraged to utilize AI tools for drafting crisp language but should personalize the tone and content to reflect his individuality authentically.

For our next session, we will aim to finalize the personal statement if Ruben provides a refined draft for feedback. If Ruben is comfortable with the personal statement progress, we might pivot to focus on admissions test questions (specifically ESAT) as Ruben hinted interest if time allows in future sessions. We have tentatively scheduled lessons on both Sunday and Wednesday for deliberate practice. Ruben has yet to confirm the exact times, and I await his reply regarding scheduling through the provided link.
