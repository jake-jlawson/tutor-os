Ruben Sinanyan: I went through with my teacher and we really cut down.
Jake Lawson: Okay, cool. So, I think I got that. Let me open it up.
Ruben Sinanyan: So I think I just need to cut it down by around 600 characters. but yeah, I still want to maintain a good quality personal payment.
Jake Lawson: So, in terms of what we want to focus on today, so we've got an hour lesson. let me just make what are kind of the main things you want to deal with? I think you said last time you just want to focus a bit more on the personal statement before moving on to Pat just so that you can get it out of the way. Is that still the case?
Ruben Sinanyan: 
Ruben Sinanyan: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think if we still have time at the end and we completely agree on a good personal statement, then I think we can maybe start introducing some Pat questions. But yeah, I guess we'll see how it goes now.
Jake Lawson: What are the main kind of issues you want to go through? are you happy with the actual content or is there still any problems in there that you want to go through this in terms of …
Ruben Sinanyan: Yeah, I think I'm pretty happy with the content.
Jake Lawson: what and how you talk about things?
Ruben Sinanyan: I mean I was just deciding because I know a few people also add in sport one or two sentences on their sport and…
Jake Lawson: Yeah. Heat.
Ruben Sinanyan: it would be cool if I could but I'm just debating it cuz I have basically very little space left and I mean I have no space and I just need to cut down. So I was wondering what Yep.
Jake Lawson: So my advice with that is I think so really Oxbridge it won't make a big difference they literally won't care about that of your personal statement because they only really care about the engineering related things. it is like you can definitely include it. and if there is space I think maybe we can free up some space and you might be able to include it because I think it might not be useful for Oxbridge but it is useful and people like to see it for other unis and as well as that I guess if it's something that you would have in common with an interviewer or something like that it could help in some way I guess.
Ruben Sinanyan: Okay.
Jake Lawson: Yeah, if you have space definitely add maybe a sentence is really all you need about anything that is not engineering related but if you have sa don't sacrifice like anything else if you don't sacrifice something else important engineering related to put it in but if we do end up creating some more space then so would you say cutting it down is the main thing that work on in Okay.
Ruben Sinanyan: Okay, cool. Yeah, that sounds good. Yeah. Yeah. Cutting it down while maintaining a good quality personal statement.
Jake Lawson: So, some strategies for cutting it down that we can kind of go through now. I would say this is a problem that everyone has really. I had this problem with my personal name and just having too much in there. the strategies you can mainly use. It's kind of like an iterative process. I think we just need to go through it once, cut some stuff, go through it again. in terms of wording, you just want to kind of simplify all the language and kind of as succinctly as possible. Chat GPT is great for doing this. So, we can use chat GT a bit in terms of asking it to word things in a way that keeps the content but makes it shorter. so let's start with doing that.
Ruben Sinanyan: Yeah, cool.
Jake Lawson: I guess we can begin with that. So yeah, I guess you can see what I'm doing here and stuff in the document. Can you and…
Ruben Sinanyan: Yes. Yeah.
Jake Lawson: I'll just maybe duplicate this and put it in another tab just so you can see the original one and then see the edits. Okay. So yeah, I've always been fascinated by the difference between the energy available on or beyond Earth and the actual energy harness to drive civilization. I think mean we almost definitely can come up with a more succinct way to write Any ideas? So
Ruben Sinanyan: Heat.
Jake Lawson: I mean this is a job for chat I think. So what is a good way to phrase this which maintains the idea of a contrast between energy harness versus available I guess is that the main point you're making in terms of interested in Yeah.

## 00:05:00
Ruben Sinanyan: Yes. Yeah.
Jake Lawson: Let me see. there was another thread where I'm turn chat duty into a personal statement editing AI thing. So, let me see if I can find that. okay. Yeah. So,
Jake Lawson: So, here's some ideas. So, I always been fascinated by again, you can use gap instead of difference. That cuts out some characters. Are the gaps between I mean do you need to say beyond Earth? Is that key to the point or can you just say the energy available?
Ruben Sinanyan: Yeah.
Jake Lawson: This is short, but is this all right or do you prefer what it was before? So that's
Ruben Sinanyan: I've always been fascinated by the gap between energy. I think that sounds good. Yeah. Yeah.
Jake Lawson: Yeah, the ability to control energy resources is a great metro program and I believe that some of the most creative pathways lie within engineer. again this doesn't make direct sense. I think what you're trying to say here in terms of I think we need to connect engineering to the energy. So it's unclear at the moment how engineering relates to this first part. So maybe we just want to amend that.
Jake Lawson: So the ability to control energy resources is a great measure of progress and I believe that some of the most creative pathways lie within engineering in this area or something like that or engineering something the ability to control energy resource I believe that some of the most creative pathways lie within engineering in this area or I believe that some
Jake Lawson: of the most creative pathways Maybe this involve engineering this or…
Ruben Sinanyan: Okay.
Jake Lawson: 
Jake Lawson: yeah something like that. I mean we need to kind of I think this can be worded slightly better.

## 00:10:00
Jake Lawson: So when you say creative pathways, what do you mean? Do you mean creative pathways for yourself to create things or creative pathways to control the energy resources?
Ruben Sinanyan: Yeah, just creative ideas and ways to be able to harness energy.
Jake Lawson: So some of these are good idea center. So if that's the case, we can rearrange it to be so ability to control energy resources is a great measure of progress. And I believe that most creative pathways to do this or will emerge through engineering like you like that.
Ruben Sinanyan: Yeah, I like that a lot. Yeah.
Jake Lawson: Is that good? Okay, cool. I enjoyed reading about the college chef's scale intricacies of drilling of the thermal geothermal energy and the theoretical exploration of a solar shield to reduce energy, the spreading scope idea Intropy again you can just reword some things like intricacies of geothermal energy drilling or something like this and I'm sure it's reading about the card scale it probably needs the intricacies of geothermal energy drills and exploring
Ruben Sinanyan: Yeah.
Jake Lawson: The use of exploring the use of a solute and on the brilliance scope of these ideas and projects coupled with the opportunities to problem have led me I think grip me so I think I don't know it sound a bit of a strange ending of the paragraph I feel like maybe it should be something I don't know can you think of alternative
Ruben Sinanyan: I guess is more characters but have captured my interest or have Yeah.
Jake Lawson: Yeah, I think that's a bit better than I think. So, I mean this is all right. I think we don't need to shorten this because it's already quite short. What I would say potentially is that at the moment these things do these crop up elsewhere in the personal statement or are you just mentioning them once?
Ruben Sinanyan: No, these don't.
Jake Lawson: I would say these ideas at the moment are slightly weak in terms of you basically don't analyze them much into detail etc.
Ruben Sinanyan: Yeah. Yeah.
Jake Lawson: So maybe they don't need to be there or develop them more. So, if you're looking for things to cut in terms of things pro that are taking up characters and don't provide much like impact, I guess these sorts of things, consider maybe they don't need to be there or expand on this.
Ruben Sinanyan: Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
Jake Lawson: And then maybe there's some stuff. maybe obviously, so if you remove this, it would look a bit weird this paragraph because it would be really short your answer to question one. I think There's a minimum characters you need for each question as well. but what you could potentially experiment with doing is maybe there's some other stuff from the rest of the personal statement that you could lift up into that to try to connect maybe some because there's a theme I guess that you have with energy. So, if there's anything else that connects to the energy, you could connect that directly up.
Ruben Sinanyan: To be fair, I kind of do mention energy when I read the essential engineer I talk about batteries but it doesn't really expand on that same idea. So I don't know what to do about that because I agree that it does look just a bit kind of weak with no explanation behind it. But I don't know…

## 00:15:00
Jake Lawson: Yeah.
Ruben Sinanyan: if I have enough space to put anywhere else to expand on it. I don't know. Yeah.
Jake Lawson: But I mean one other possible solution. So I think in particular the things that are really weak are in my opinion I think they might as well just not be there they're not adding anything. the Cardiff scale. The possible solution is remove the focus remove the other two things and then add a bit about how the card is chev basically just add a reflection about the card scale and how it links to the interest you have…
Ruben Sinanyan: Okay. Yeah.
Jake Lawson: because you kind of just want to build a profile a bit of yourself and show okay this is where my interest comes from. this is kind of some of the things I've read and this is how they connect with the interest or how they helped me decide that this was my fundamental interest. Makes sense. Okay, let's just see…
Ruben Sinanyan: Yeah. Yeah.
Jake Lawson: 
Jake Lawson: if we can shorten some of this. creating and presenting an academic symposium on city development gave me the chance to explore how engineering and AI merge together. so how are your qualifications? so again certain certain so I would say something like I or I delivered so instead of creating and presenting you can kind of combined with created and I think I delivered a symposium. so I don't think you need to mention academic and then maybe I would maybe consider mentioning the context behind this because at the moment it seems a bit like there's not specific context. So maybe I'd consider just writing school or something.
Ruben Sinanyan: Yeah.
Jake Lawson: I delivered a symposium at school on city development which gave me this which instead gave me this time allowed me to explore how engineering and AI merge together to shape the future of infrastructure allowed me to explore something like you could say instead the intersection of engineering and AI to shape the future of Are you happy with that? That's just like I guess I'm quicker way to say that.
Ruben Sinanyan: Yeah.
Jake Lawson: I was particularly interested in how AI could again potentially is kind of you don't need to have that could act as a city's operating system including predicting energy demand and managing the roles such as predicting I think yeah I mean the roles such as I think this just kind of sounds best such as predicting…
Ruben Sinanyan: Yeah. No,…
Jake Lawson: and adaptive is that a key is this important do you think or
Ruben Sinanyan: 
Ruben Sinanyan: to be honest. Yeah, I think you can cut it out.
Jake Lawson: So how AI can act as a city's operating system and…
Ruben Sinanyan: We can
Jake Lawson: roles to predicting energy demand and management so I just think became aware I mean you can I guess that's short but I became aware of the risks that come with such as how misallocated power mining this experience I became
Jake Lawson: I became aware of the risks You can just say it all of and then become aware of the risks of this. is that right or wrong? So I also became aware of the risk or aware of I don't know maybe we go back

## 00:20:00
Ruben Sinanyan: I'm just trying to think…
Jake Lawson: to Yeah.
Ruben Sinanyan: where I say I became aware of the risks. I'm just trying to search things that maybe could shorten that.
Jake Lawson: I also think maybe
Ruben Sinanyan: I mean, yeah.
Jake Lawson: I don't know. It doesn't flow very well, I think.
Jake Lawson: I think also you could change it like I was particularly interested in how AI could act and how AI by performing No, that's not working.
Jake Lawson: I became aware of the risks that come yeah I guess yeah how about this at the same time I became aware of the risks such as how misallocated power could overwhelm turbines or transformers Thank goodness.
Ruben Sinanyan: at the same time we came away. Also, I just noticed that the next sentence where I say combining this experience with my studies of energy conver conservation, stress and strain, algorithms, and computational thinking just sounds a bit like a list.
Jake Lawson: Yeah, This can be properly really short. So you can say instead of combining this experience, you kind of want to say I combined my knowledge of energy, stress, strain.
Jake Lawson: I combined my knowledge of energy stress and stress strain So again algorithms and computational thinking they're not exactly the same thing but they are similar. You don't need both of them. I combined and…
Ruben Sinanyan: Yeah.
Jake Lawson: applied my knowledge to propose the idea of a digital twin for each physical system that could be tested cheating many times. I think this works better propose the idea of a digital twin for each physical system that could be tested cheaply many times.

## 00:25:00
Ruben Sinanyan: Yeah. Yeah, I agree.
Jake Lawson: Again, it's adding characters, but I do feel like maybe you need just a sentence at the end of this to explain how this actually relates to that problem. So I guess what's a short way you can do this? I combined and applied my knowledge of energy, stress, strain and comput computational thinking the idea of a digital twin for each system that the AI could use cheaply.
Jake Lawson: or could use to cheaply test to propose the other that the AI could use to cheaply test its decisions and avoid or maybe to cheaply invalidate decisions. Yeah. How's that?
Ruben Sinanyan: Yeah.
Jake Lawson: The one thing I would say, so this is interesting. again what I would say here is if you want to be a bit more technically relevant try to and again I think you can probably find a way to do this without adding loads of characters if but try to focus specifically on or at least name kind of the blackbox problem. So I guess what this is you haven't really identified you've said what a risk is that potentially you could misallocate power but you haven't actually connected that to why an AI might misallocate power. So you could obviously misallocating power
Ruben Sinanyan: Okay.
Jake Lawson: is a risk but that doesn't at the moment seem like a risk of AI specifically because theoretically that could happen if a human was managing it or whatever. So, if you can somehow connect why will the maybe misallocate power? the main reason we'd be worried that it would is because we don't really know what's going on inside the AI. it can hallucinate.
Ruben Sinanyan: Yeah. Heat.
Jake Lawson: It can do stuff that we don't understand. So, we don't want to give it such power over such important systems. And then I guess that then ties into the suggestion that you found or that you kind of came up to validate this so that the AI generations aren't just kind of left to do whatever or the decision is validated. Does that make sense? So I would just maybe see we won't see if it shouldn't take too long just maybe can use AI for figuring that out as well but see if you can actually connect the problem directly to the AI and then connect the solution to it as well. Does that make sense?
Ruben Sinanyan: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Jake Lawson: So again you can just say for this I achieved goal and highest in the year in the digits.
Ruben Sinanyan: Also, with that small paragraph about the senior math and physics challenge, I just realized it's all one sentence,…
Jake Lawson: Yeah. Yeah.
Ruben Sinanyan: which, seems weird to maybe we could break it down into two, maybe I'm wrong, but
Jake Lawson: So I achieved gold in highest near and senior physics challenge so you say goal twice. So maybe is there a way to combine I achieved goal in the senior challenge and let's see if again this is a job so this sentence mentions goal twice.

## 00:30:00
Jake Lawson: Is there a way to combine that into one mention of goal whilst also keeping the part about highest in the year? I think that's an important bit.
Ruben Sinanyan: Okay.
Jake Lawson: Yeah. Something like So I achieved goals with the highest score in my year in the senior physics challenge along with consecutive golds four years in a row in the intermediate senior math
Jake Lawson: Okay, I think that's a bit of a better way to reword it. so I think that should be one sentence and then we go into another sentence.
Ruben Sinanyan: Yeah, that's true.
Jake Lawson: So again, some of these are I think not super relevant. For example, showcasing strong problem solving skills. You don't need to say that because that's kind of just you've already showcased them like you don't need to demonstrate that you've showcased them because if you've got gold in those then you obviously skills. So I achieve gold doing these things. I also work I also prepare with other humans.
Jake Lawson: helping me learn maybe that's something good again there's some things that if you really need to cut stuff out there's certain things that are definitely easy to cut out. For example, you can leave it in for now, but if you're running out of space and you really don't want it in there, it really I don't think puts a lot of impact. these sort of soft skills are I guess they're all right, but they're like if you got rid of it, it would have been missed in other words. Does that make sense?
Ruben Sinanyan: Okay.
Jake Lawson: When engineering tutors are reading your personal statement, they would probably read something like soft skills like I learned teamwork or I learned collaboration as kind of just a given, I guess, things that they would expect anyway. it's not something super interesting that they would be impressed by or that they would find interesting. So again, can leave it in but cut if you need space because this is not super impactful. okay. Are you happy with that rephrasing of that?
Ruben Sinanyan: Yes. Yeah, I like that.
Jake Lawson: Launching a school magazine on technology and AI gave me the opportunity to grow both my leadership and analytical skills. My work on the magazine has included promoting, curating, editing and writing. I have generated a lot of interest in the magazine expanding readership and earning a mention by Ted Max. More articles are written than can be placed and I worked hard to one article I wrote explored the ethical challenges of So there's a lot that can be cut in here. Again, a lot so I would mention here about basically show don't tell. So things like I developed my leadership and analytical skills. Again, these are soft skills that won't really impress that much because they're easy, but it's more impressive if you show them.

## 00:35:00
Jake Lawson: So I guess you can even remove this or remove the leadership because the fact you mention things like you've done all this promoting, you've started up, that's kind of showing leadership anyway. So you don't necessarily need to explicitly mention it.
Ruben Sinanyan: Yeah, that's true.
Jake Lawson: The other thing I would say potentially and I actually came up with so you know how I said I was going to write to you like I did come up with so I kind of used chat GPT and…
Ruben Sinanyan: Yeah.
Jake Lawson: came up with a good way to write about this. Let me just paste it in so that you can maybe get some inspiration from it.
Jake Lawson: I mean, so obviously this is used a lot of creative license. So a lot of this stuff might not be relevant to you, but this is the sort of way that I think would be good to write something like your magazine. But what I notice at the moment is again it's focusing a lot on the soft skills and about things that are adjacent to engineering but not actually the engineering part. Whereas if I think a good way to rewrite it or to try to write about it would be to try to connect. So even though it's like an ethics thing the article focus on the article you wrote even though it's more like an ethics thing you can connect it to technical aspects. So a lot of the ethical challenges that AI has arise directly because of technical things directly because of the model architecture or the way that it's been designed or the way that the code runs or the data that's been chosen things like that.
Jake Lawson: So if you try to focus on those aspects I think that comes across much more impressive and much more interesting for an engineering teacher. So yeah just have a read of this. I guess this is the example that I came up with. so again you would need to replace the technical stuff with things that you've actually looked at. but you can see kind of the idea of this you're focusing on…
Ruben Sinanyan: Yeah. Yeah.
Jake Lawson: what you've learned about the technical aspects and then you're using that related to the ethics and what you wrote about. Does that make sense?
Ruben Sinanyan: Camp's getting interested in** challenges.
Ruben Sinanyan: Yeah. Yeah, I like that paragraph. feel in mine especially from where I say just
Jake Lawson: So I would just say try to a lot of this soft skills can be mentioned and it's I guess good to mention but I would even say something like this whole six lines would be just as effective if it was one sentence and then the rest of the paragraph focused on some of the more technical things. Does that make sense? Because you could say all of this which is basically saying that you started it up. You had some good leadership skills and it became really popular. that's what this whole part is basically saying. so I think you can probably work out a way to say that in one sentence and then the rest of the paragraph be dedicated to expanding a bit on the Does that make sense?
Ruben Sinanyan: Mhm. Yeah. Yeah.
Jake Lawson: 
Jake Lawson: Okay, cool. So yeah, let's try to move on because we only have 15 minutes left, I think. So I just want to make sure that we get through the whole thing and I can give you some more feedback. So this next part then I read structures by J Gordon to deepen my understanding of material failure. I learned that metal components are undergoing repeat stresses especially during land. yeah I would say maybe to shorten this I would say reading structures by J foren deepened my understanding

## 00:40:00
Jake Lawson: of material failure I learned that again you can say metals s and undergoing repeated stresses because again it doesn't necessarily have to be in planes. You can maybe add a bit in planes after undergoing so metals used in aircraft. and I think especially during take up and landing, I think it's mostly the vast majority of repeated stress cycles happen during takeoff and landing. So I think
Ruben Sinanyan: Yeah, Could you also talk about pressure changes?
Jake Lawson: just say something like I learned that metals used in aircraft gather accumulated strain when they undergo repeated take off and landing stress cycles something like that I think that's a bit shorter.
Ruben Sinanyan: So that could cause a lot of stress and cracks. but I don't know if
Jake Lawson: Yeah, I think this is good for now. I mean you can edit it…
Ruben Sinanyan: Thank
Jake Lawson: so I said reading structures by Jay Gordon deep in my understanding material pay I learned the metals used in aircraft gather accumulate strain when they undergo repeated takeoff and landing stress cycles or is this necessarily accurate? So I learned the in aircraft gather accumulated strains. I learned that metals used in air or that accumulate drain gathered in metals using aircraft. Okay.
Jake Lawson: this you can remove is not like it's kind of Thank you.
Jake Lawson: combined with geometries like square windows early. I mean do you like this? I think this is One thing I would say you definitely need so you can't just so this again is very descriptive.
Ruben Sinanyan: Yeah, I think that's good.
Jake Lawson: It's telling it's talking about what you learn the specifics that you learn but you either here at the end you need to add some personalization in terms of I think we talked about the things to add. It's either you need to add an opinion of a new insight you learned about engineering I don't know maybe something you are looking forward to or a key takeaway or something like that just a connection to your interest just something that makes this rather than just saying yeah I read this and then these are all the things I learned. Try to actually give a personal way that what you learned impacted you or a key takeaway or an opinion that you have on what you learn to make it more personal.
Jake Lawson: Make sense?
Ruben Sinanyan: Okay. Yeah.
Jake Lawson: 
Jake Lawson: This is interesting. So I also read the essential engineer gave me a deep appreciation of the difference between science and engineering. While battery technology has improved drastically over the last 15 years,…

## 00:45:00
Ruben Sinanyan: I
Jake Lawson: a shrewd engineering solution might have been to reimplement trolley buses that did not require expend recharging topic. Yeah. tell me a bit. I'm not too sure…
Ruben Sinanyan: I No,…
Jake Lawson: what your
Ruben Sinanyan: that was just like an idea that I had which kind of was more personalized. But now that I think of it, I feel like maybe I should expand a bit more on the essential engineer. And what I said here just seems a bit out of context. But what I meant to say is a idea that connected by reading the essential engineer.
Jake Lawson: So, I agree. I was going to ask a bit more in detail about that because it does seem a bit out of place, but it's a good idea in terms of what you're trying to do here. So, trying to expand on this and…
Ruben Sinanyan: Yeah.
Jake Lawson: make it more personal, come up with an idea to link it or to personalized it or something like this. I think that's a good thing to do. So, definitely develop that Any more questions for question two before we go on to question three.
Ruben Sinanyan: No. that seems good, I think.
Jake Lawson: So again, just based on what I know about your experiences, what you've told me and what I've read in the previous drafts, this stuff is the biggest kind of the content, the value. I think…
Ruben Sinanyan: Yeah. Yeah.
Jake Lawson: though this should be necessarily most of it, but I'm just looking at this it seems at the moment like your question two is longer than your question three.
Ruben Sinanyan: Yeah. Yeah.
Jake Lawson: 
Jake Lawson: I don't that should be the case. Question three should definitely be longer than question two because it's got I think it more to So, I completed two-month internship with Saffron, a company that had not previously taken on school students. I explored the use of composite landming a large band dias resulting in a higher bypass ratio whilst maintaining a narrow frame. experience the importance of efficiency and precision when this is good detail I guess
Jake Lawson: Yeah. I think this is good. this one's written really well, I think, in terms of you're saying what you did. You're giving lots of technical detail from the technical detail. You're extracting insights that you gained. You're kind of showing some critical thinking. I think this is the way to write that when you're thinking about how do I write, this is definitely the way to write to see if you can try to replicate this same structure throughout the rest of the personal statement as well.
Jake Lawson: So I think yeah we can see if we can shorten this at all but it looks good. and developing a robotic arm with a conveyor belt and camera system integrating AI for object recognition. training the AI to detect materials under different lightings, orientations and occlusions taught me the importance of again you don't need the importance of robust data sets while using roblow annotation help ensure calculated ST torque requirements for stepper and server motors.
Jake Lawson: I guess using four requirements you can say using torque requirements I calculated I was able to pick appropriate step and serotus think that's slightly shorter than that. Yeah. I completed a cat pause and use CAD with the reading printing to design parts that balance efficiency.

## 00:50:00
Jake Lawson: Yeah, I mean I think this looks good. We've shortened it slightly, but overall I think that's good. Again, there was also so chat GPT also came with a reasonably in my opinion good or again I'll paste this in here because you might be able to extract some inspiration from this when you're talking about the first part of G3. So this is the chat GPT generated paragraph leap for your SAP RAM internship I guess.
Ruben Sinanyan: Yeah.
Jake Lawson: So feel free to have a quick read of that and see if you like anything there in particular. I'll see if there's anything I think you should
Jake Lawson: Yeah, I think a lot of this is quite good actually to be honest.
Ruben Sinanyan: Yeah. Yeah.
Jake Lawson: I think this part when you talk specifically the way some of this is worded is quite good I think. And then also the part again this is probably way too long.
Ruben Sinanyan: I like the way that it's phrased.
Jake Lawson: 
Jake Lawson: Yeah. Yeah. This is probably way too long but some of this the way that it's talking about it is really good in terms of it's showing that you contributed. It's framing it as a engineering problem which that was in my prompt that I gave it actually. I said frame this a really very good engineering problem where you actually made a difference. So I think taking some of the inspiration from this and trying to come up with maybe something that combines some of the stuff you've written here with some of the stuff here and kind of keeps the key ideas that we like. So things like the way that it's talking about that experience and things like that.
Ruben Sinanyan: Okay.
Jake Lawson: 
Jake Lawson: 
Jake Lawson: Does that make sense? So, we're kind of nearing the end of the on. any other questions or any kind of things you want to deal with last minute?
Ruben Sinanyan: No. I think just one question.
Jake Lawson: I mean,…
Ruben Sinanyan: I mean, I just kind of scroll back to the top. Do you think the very first sentence is fine? I
Jake Lawson: so on it in isolation. Yeah. Yeah, it's a fine way to start your personal statement. The only thing that I guess I would worry about in terms of your Q1 at the moment it seems like it doesn't really relate very much to anything else that you've written. So it seems a bit out of place to me when I'm reading this it seems like this Q1 is from a different personal statement and…
Ruben Sinanyan: Yeah. Yeah.
Jake Lawson: 
Jake Lawson: that's from the stuff in Q2. So think about maybe a way you can make it more coherent in terms of and maybe you've modified a bit to fit with what you've done in the rest of it or maybe you tried to tweak some of the things you said in the rest of it to connect back to the idea of energy and stuff like that. again sorry go ahead.
Ruben Sinanyan: I Yeah,…
Jake Lawson: 
Jake Lawson: What were you going to say?
Ruben Sinanyan: I was just going to say maybe I could implement how I'm also really kind of interested in implementing into helping us solve these solutions. Maybe.
Jake Lawson: Yeah. Yeah. That is a great thing that you can add so if you add something about integration of AI and how that interests you about engineering that is really good because it comes the idea of AI comes up three different times in different parts of your so that's definitely a good idea again if you need more ideas for how to write your Q1 or how to introduce and connect everything just remember some of links that we came up with last time in the other document…

## 00:55:00
Ruben Sinanyan: Okay.
Jake Lawson: 
Jake Lawson: because those are useful. But AI is a good link. So if you AI is definitely something I would maybe include or try to modify the first paragraph to do cool makes sense.
Ruben Sinanyan: 
Ruben Sinanyan: Yeah. I'll work on that then.
Jake Lawson: So just as a summary I guess when I write the report I'll give some of these summaries and bullet points but yeah the biggest thing would be just to some of the content in Q2 I think could still be modified in terms of it's a lot of general soft skills I'd rather see some more technical discussion some more like personal reflection and then the qu Q3 is generally pretty good, but I would just consider there's ways that you can definitely make it more impactful in terms of trying to use some of the ideas from some of the AI generated. again, obviously it's sometimes very tempting to just copy the chat thing because it's quite good at a lot of the different things. Try not to do that, I guess.
Jake Lawson: But try you could definitely take significant inspiration with the way that it's writing about it and try to write your own similar thing.
Ruben Sinanyan: Okay, cool.
Jake Lawson: 
Jake Lawson: Cool. And then once you've got an updated draft, feel free to send to me. I can give some more comments.
Ruben Sinanyan: Yeah. Yeah.
Jake Lawson: And then I think yeah, we don't have another lesson scheduled yet, but do you want Sunday?
