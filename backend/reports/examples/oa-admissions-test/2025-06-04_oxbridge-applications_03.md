# Lesson Title: "PAT Problem Solving - Reading & Understanding the Question"

## Summary & Student Progress
We began the lesson with just a brief discussion of my plan for how I will support [Student Name] with the PAT and ensure that they can ace that exam and give themselves as much of a chance as possible at an interview invite and final offer. I wanted to ensure that [Student Name] was happy with the plan I have, and so we went through the lesson schedule for the next few months. Based on my usual PAT course, we will begin with covering fundamental problem solving techniques, while [Student Name] will cover and review the content by themselves. They should let me know as they review topics so I can test them and ensure they have a deep understanding. After this we will work on strengthening content and topic-specific problem solving approaches. After this, we will work on handling the time pressure and getting faster, and finally we will put this all into practice with consistent drills, practice questions and other activities. Here is a full outline:

- 2nd & 3rd Week of July: Getting PAT questions correct - problem solving approaches.  
- Last week of July through August: Content Strengthening and Topic-specific problems.  
- First 2 weeks of September: Speed & Efficiency.  
- Final 4 weeks leading up to PAT: Exam strategy, familiarity, and lots of practice.  

We also realised that [Student Name] has lots of lesson hours available so we agreed that we would leave 15 hours for potential interview prep, meaning we have an additional 9 lessons that we can schedule for PAT preparation, meaning [Student Name] can likely move to 2 lessons per week as we move closer to the PAT.

After finalising the PAT plan, we focused today on PAT Problem Solving. I got [Student Name] to analyse their own problem solving approach with a difficult spring question. They came up with many good ideas and their approach is already solid, employing many useful techniques. To really maximise how they are problem solving they should start seeing the more abstract and general steps that they do to approach each problem rather than the problem-specific steps, so that they can optimise these. Overall, the first, perhaps most important step of solving hard problems is to really understand them first. This is what we covered the rest of the lesson, and we reviewed various strategies for gaining a proper understanding of hard questions. [Student Name] generally performed well on many of the problems I gave them. They managed to get the correct answer frequently, and although they were frustrated because they were slow, I don’t think that is a massive deal at the moment! Here is some further general feedback [Student Name] could implement to improve even more:

- Think of ways to do a sanity check or double check your answers at the end of questions to ensure you catch errors like the one in the first spring question.  
- Remember that Impulse is just change in momentum not change in momentum / time.  
- Try and use as much mental maths as possible - simplify things before putting them in the calculator since the calculator is clunky (as we have seen today!).  
- Backward-reasoning (where you ask what must cause the observation) is a useful problem solving approach - for the projectile motion question, it may have helped to ask “what must be true for this situation to arise (landing in the cart)”. This may have led you to realise that just the horizontal velocities must match.  
- Try and get into the habit of avoiding just jumping into the question straight away with a biased or preconceived notion of a solution. Spend time to understand the question and plot your course first. It may seem counterintuitive because it will add time but as seen in the projectile motion question, oftentimes it may be simpler than it initially seems.  

## Homework & Plans for Next Session
As discussed in the lesson, [Student Name] should keep up our PAT preparation by continuing to tackle a wide variety of difficult problems from different sources (PAT past papers, BPhO, etc.). A comprehensive variety of sources can be found in this presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kHL-ItSoVvk2mLAB0sgsdjA326igALo6HacMjW6ZcpU/edit?usp=sharing. Feel free to bring any problems you want some help with to future lessons.

As well as this, continue to work on reviewing the syllabus, and keep me updated of your progress here as well.

Next lesson we will continue our PAT preparation, following the plan that we discussed, and continue the review, discussion and practice of problem solving approaches and strategies, and how to handle difficult problems, such as the ones that show up in the PAT. Our focus next time will be on actually tackling the problem once you have fully understood it.
