# Lesson Title: "PAT Content: Solar System (Orbits, Eclipses, & Planet Positions)

## Summary & Student Progress
Today’s lesson we returned to PAT preparation. We have finished reviewing the content, but [Student Name] wanted to go into a bit more detail and work a little more on solar system-based questions which we had not got around to yet. This formed the main focus of the session, and then for the final 10–15 minutes we started to discuss problem solving and the next stage of our plan for PAT preparation.

[Student Name] showed good intuition for most of the solar system problems we tackled. They remembered all the ideas we covered when doing circular motion and were able to effectively apply these to orbit problems, and were able to apply Kepler’s laws to determine how orbital radius would impact the orbital period. They used diagrams strongly as a tool to understand problems and set up their solutions. There were a few things I noticed that maybe they could improve, including that some problems took them a while to make progress. I think this will improve more as we focus specifically on developing and practicing useful techniques for solving difficult problems. As we discussed in the lesson, they should also try to speak their thoughts out loud while working through the question as this will help me see how they are thinking, and is also good practice for interviews.

In summary, here are the key takeaways and learnings from today’s lesson:

- For circular orbits, analyse them by equating centripetal force with gravitational force. You can also use Kepler’s Laws which state that T² is proportional to r³.  
- For elliptical orbits, analyse them using conservation of energy. Much like SHM, an elliptical orbit is a system with constant total energy, which exchanges energy between kinetic and potential depending on the position in the orbit.  
- Geostationary orbits are orbits that orbit at the same rate as the earth turns such that they always stay above the same point on the earth.  
- When analysing moon phases and eclipses, the best strategy is to identify the bodies you are interested in and try to understand their positions and motion relative to one another. This can be done quite effectively with diagrams.  

## Homework & Plans for Next Session
For homework, the Miro board contains many more Solar System questions (in fact I think the majority of solar system questions from all PAT papers), so it would definitely be useful for [Student Name] to complete more of these to ensure they are strong at handling these types of questions. From now on, as they complete more questions they should try to get into a reflective mindset where after answering questions they self-evaluate what they did well and whether there is anything that could have improved in their problem solving process. This will come in handy when we move onto problem solving in the next lesson.

At this point, [Student Name] can also start to complete some of the OA mock PAT papers. I have sent them one to do before the next lesson. Complete this under exam conditions, go through and mark it, reflect on what went well and the questions you got wrong, then bring any questions you have to our next lesson.

Towards the end, we discussed the plan for the final few PAT sessions before the test. Our focus now is on problem solving skills and techniques for speed/exam technique. We will use the next few lessons we have to solve many difficult PAT problems and practice/discuss techniques to make solving difficult questions easier and quicker. We will also try to get more familiar with different question types and nuances of the exam, such as using the online calculator, etc.

As I discussed with [Student Name] in the lesson, I think they should review their total credits and see how many they want to use for admissions test prep so we can ensure that we schedule enough lessons to get the most out of PAT preparation.
