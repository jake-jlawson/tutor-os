# Lesson Title: "Admissions Test Content (PAT): Circular Motion & Electric Fields"

## Summary & Student Progress
Today’s lesson continued to focus on admissions test prep. In particular, we are exploring and deepening [Student Name]’s understanding of the PAT content, especially any topics [Student Name] needs to cover or work through. Content mastery is the foundation of doing well on the PAT. Today’s lesson practiced circular motion as well as beginning to talk about Electric Fields.

Circular motion was a topic [Student Name] had identified as not having been covered yet in their Physics A Level class, but they had started it recently. [Student Name] showed a strong understanding of circular motion and often was able to explain themselves well when I asked difficult questions about the fundamentals of circular motion, such as how we know the force is directed towards the center of the circle. We attempted a difficult BPhO question centered around the derivation of the centripetal acceleration equation which [Student Name] was able to handle well. After this we practiced a PAT question, which with some hints [Student Name] was able to work through.  [Student Name] should remember that when applying circular motion to real life problems, the strategy is to figure out the force producing the centripetal force (gravitational, normal, tension, etc.) and equate this to the centripetal force formula (mv²/r). We finally discussed the difference between centripetal and centrifugal force, and discussed the idea of a “fictitious” force and what this actually means.

We also had time to briefly introduce Electric Fields. [Student Name] was already familiar with the force between two charged particles, and we used this idea to explore fields. We also had a deeper discussion into what fields actually mean / are mathematically, and how we can set up a mathematical model for an electric field around a point charge. As we discussed, this knowledge is not necessary for the PAT, but becoming a master of the PAT content is all about exploring these deeper questions and ensuring your fundamental understanding of the ideas from maths and physics are comprehensive and detailed. We ended the lesson doing a PAT question related to two charged spheres. [Student Name] struggled with this question a bit and didn’t know how to start it, but as we walked through it they were able to follow and figure out how to get the solution. As discussed, a tip for [Student Name] to be able to do this themselves without my help would be to consider the “whys” of the question. If we are trying to calculate the angle, consider why the angle arises in the first place and what factors impact how big or small it is. From this you can figure out that the force balance is what determines this angle, and you can use this to calculate the angle.

## Homework & Plans for Next Session
I left links in the Miro board with some further questions. As we discussed in the lesson, the BPhO questions are extremely valuable for the PAT as they often test your fundamental/deep understanding of the physics principles. For homework, I recommend that [Student Name] does some more PAT-style and BPhO problems on circular motion to ensure that they have reached a solid level of understanding and can also apply their knowledge. Focus should be on applications of circular motion.

We did not get around to finishing Electric Fields, so [Student Name] should continue to review this independently and next lesson we will cover it in more detail, delve into some deeper questions, and put it all into practice with PAT-style problems.  I was also pleased to see a first draft of [Student Name]’s PS that they sent me, so I will review that and send back some feedback soon.
